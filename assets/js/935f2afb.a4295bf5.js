However, we encountered some pain points with Redux so went in search of a different solution to meet our needs and landed on mobx-state-tree (also known as \\"MST\\"). We find that it\u2019s a great middle-ground between completely structured (like redux) and completely freestyle (like mobx). It brings more than just state-management to the table as well (such as dependency injection, serialization, and lifecycle events).","sidebar":"Ignite"},"ignite-cli/concept/Navigation":{"id":"ignite-cli/concept/Navigation","title":"Navigation in Ignite","description":"We use React Navigation v6 in the current version of Ignite.
